# Discription
- The program is designed to create a GUI for a University Information System with four radio buttons. It reads two text files containing information about instructors and departments. Depending on the selected radio button, it allows users to retrieve and display details about instructors or departments. The GUI includes features for submitting, clearing, and quitting. The displayed information is formatted and left-aligned. If the entered ID or department name is not found, appropriate messages are shown in the specified format. The program handles any number of lines in the input files and maintains a consistent layout throughout.
